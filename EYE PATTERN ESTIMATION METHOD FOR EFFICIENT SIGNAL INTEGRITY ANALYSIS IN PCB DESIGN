ABSTRACT:

This project presents an efficient Eye Pattern Estimation Method for enhancing signal integrity analysis in high-speed PCB designs. 
Eye patterns are critical for evaluating voltage and timing margins, providing insights into signal quality.
The proposed method utilizes advanced computational algorithms to model and predict signal behavior under noise, jitter, and crosstalk
conditions, enabling accurate simulation of high-frequency signal transmission. By incorporating adaptive filtering, it isolates key performance 
metrics such as eye height, eye width, and bit error rates, ensuring detailed analysis with minimal computational effort. Experimental results
validate the method’s effectiveness in improving design validation efficiency, reducing design cycle times, and enhancing the reliability of high-speed 
communication interfaces. This scalable approach addresses the growing demands of next-generation electronic systems, offering a practical and cost-effective solution for PCB designers.
